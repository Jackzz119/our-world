// rig-director.ts — decides WHICH pose shows: the pose of the character's real state, overridden for
// a moment by short reactions (a glance up, a poke, a held pat) or played through a keyframe
// sequence (taking a sip: reach, lift, drink, put it back). Pure logic, no clock or randomness of its
// own, so a test can replay a sequence exactly. The view only renders what `update` returns, and asks
// `transition()` how to animate the change.
//
// Rules it enforces:
//   - a reaction never interrupts a stronger one (priority), a repeat extends the running one
//   - reactions only land in the states that allow them (nobody pokes an empty chair)
//   - idle reactions are timed from the last time the character settled back, not wall-clock
//   - every chain's neighbouring frames form one map: whenever the pose changes between two poses the
//     map links (writing -> patted, asleep -> reading), it walks the frames in between one small step
//     at a time instead of morphing straight across
//   - a keyframe sequence always starts from its first frame: from anything else the character first
//     goes there (along the map, or slowly in one move); once running nothing but a state change stops
//     it, and a state change first walks it back to its first frame instead of jumping out of the middle
//   - a held keyframe reaction (a pat) walks in, stays on its last frame while held, and walks out
